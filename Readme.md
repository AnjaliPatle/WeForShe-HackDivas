Through our proposed solution, we have tried to build a platform that enables the user to do collaborative shopping and have attempted to provide the same experience of shopping as they would have had in person together at the comfort of sitting at home. Ours is a unique meeting app, where users can share screens where the screen actually has the store. We aim at providing with a platform where one can easily share their opinnions, ideas and seek suggestions from friends and family in real time. Also, we are trying to prevent the inconvenience of using differnt apps for communication, hence a one stop platform from browsing to sharing to ultimately buying, making it a unique and hassle-free experience.


## Tech Stack
* <b>React</b> - Frontend of the application
* <b>HTML, Bootstrap, CSS</b> - Design of the Interface 
* <b>Node.js</b> - Backend of the application 
* <b>Socket.io</b>- To open a communication session between multiple users and facilitate screen sharing and access.

## Features
* <b>Group Video Call</b> - The participants can get together virtually over a video call, hence giving the shopping experience a corporeal feel.   
* <b>Screen Share</b> - The user has the feasibility of sharing one’s screen with the other participants, so that they get to show the products they like and seek suggestions.
* <b>Group Wish List</b> -where everyone can save, suggest, add and view items introducing visibility and accessibility to each other’s choices.
* <b>Group Chat</b>- We have provided the users with chat feature where they can share their ideas and thoughts in real time, while still sharing their screens.
