Through our proposed solution, we have tried to build a platform that enables the user to do collaborative shopping and have attempted to provide the same experience of shopping as they would have had in person together at the comfort of sitting at home. Ours is a unique meeting app, where users can share screens where the screen actually has the store. We aim at providing with a platform where one can easily share their opinnions, ideas and seek suggestions from friends and family in real time. Also, we are trying to prevent the inconvenience of using differnt apps for communication, hence a one stop platform from browsing to sharing to ultimately buying, making it a unique and hassle-free experience.
